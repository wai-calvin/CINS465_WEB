Difficulties:

The biggest aspect of this project that I struggled with was figuring out how much of the code from my original Javascript file I could use in React. Also, because React allows me to setState() of certain variables, it was slightly challenging learning how to apply that to my original Javascript code. As well as, the one thing I struggled the most with was figuring out how to connect my hangman-react.html to my hangman-react.js file without App.js. It was confusing to switch between developing with npm and then seeing slightly different results in ssh.
